This project is a backend application developed as part of a technical assessment. It is designed to manage file uploads and downloads, with a hierarchical structure of spaces, folders, and files. The application is built using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, and is containerized using Docker.

## Problem Statement 🎯

The application is designed to solve the following problems:

1. Reverse substrings between each pair of parentheses in a given string.
2. Query a database to get a list of users who took the same training lesson more than once on the same day.
3. Design a system for managing file uploads and downloads, with a hierarchical structure of spaces, folders, and files.
